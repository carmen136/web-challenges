// In the `./index.js` file, there is a `cards` array with three objects.

// Below this array, you will find a couple of variables (e.g. `lowerCaseAnswers`). They all are initialized with `null`.

// And now it's your turn: delete the value `null` and write code such that the variables have a value corresponding to their name. Use `map` to achieve this goal.

// You will find some hints as comments.
